## Wireless Assisted Serial Port Firmware

***This is a Work in Progress***

The current example is based on a fork of the drogue-esp8266 crate with modifications to support version 2.1.0.0 of the ESP-AT firmware

The current example is designed to work with a STM32F407. The HW currently includes a STM32F103.
